C:\dev\docs\axios-fetch-react-router

minimal presentation of:
    1. syntax difference between axios and fetch
    2. functioning of react-router in 6.0.0

axios and fetch api calls are combined with react-router to
go to a separate page to view an individual item from the
data that was fetched

using Next for routing seems better

start:
    npm start

to update code on github:
    git add .
    git commit -m "message"
    git push
