C:\dev\docs\axios-fetch-react-router

Minimal presentation of:  
- difference between axios and fetch  
- fetch with 'async/await' vs fetch with 'then'
- functioning of react-router in 6.0.0

Axios and Fetch api calls are made, then react-router is used 
to view an item from the retrieved data.

Using Next for routing seems better.

start:
    npm start

to update code on github:
